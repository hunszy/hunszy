## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a fourth year electical engineering student. I have a passion for RTL design, particularly in AI/ML, signal processing, and audio. I've designed an electronic music synthesizer, and a mobile hybrid power generator. I also like to race autonomous racecars.

I am still learning about everything, but I am always open to new projects and ideas!
